#              PLEASE, READ BEFORE EXECUTE THIS SCRIPT!!!!
#
#
# This script is using TOR GEOIP to avoid create circuits or use the same coutry as TOR "ENTRY NODE" and TOR "EXIT NODE". 
# In another words, we will always have "hops" in relays from different countries difficulting the correlation of events
# due to the high fragmentation of request among TOR INSTANCES running in different countries.
# 
# Think about what is the effort necessary for your adversary to be able to compromise a TOR node in divergents countries like:
#    United States, Russia, Japan, China, North Korea, South Korea, Brazil, Sweden, Island, Ukraine etc.
# Those countries have different laws and legal bureaucracies. The legal privacy breach could not be so easy.
#
# Ok, but let's consider that your adversary could be able to compromise the entire TOR NETWORK. Now think about the effort necessary
# to your adversary be able to correlate all your requestes fragmented between all different TOR Instances running in different countries
# and using different TOR circuits for each request. Well... GOOD LUCK GUYS! Try harder!
#
# 
# You can control the selection of countries and it will affect the choice of "ENTRY NODES" or the choice of "EXIT NODES".
# By default the script will specify the countries to be used as ENTRY NODES and will use any other country as "EXIT NODES"                 
# but never user the same country that was selected to be used as ENTRY NODE.
#
# If you need to bypass a GeoIP protection, you can define the countries that will be used as EXIT-NODES. In this mode you will always,
# hit your target using IP's from the specific countries.
#
# If you realy need a FAST connection, you can force the SCRIPT to use the SAME COUNTRY for all TOR NETWORK hops.
# It means that the script will create the TOR INSTANCE USING the SAME COUNTRY as ENTRY NODE, "INTERNAL TOR JUMP NODE" and EXIT NODE.
# In summary you're reducing the DELAY between the hops and ensuring the BEST SPEED PERFORMANCE of the TOR instance.
# CAUTION! This option is not considered a safe option, because your adversary can COMPROMISE the ENTRY and the EXIT node and correlate your
# internet traffic. In another hand you can use a high number of COUNTRIES to reduce the amount of data that your adversary will be able to collect.
#
# The options available are:
#  1) entry:     This is the default option and the best approach for security and anonimity.
#                      The load balancing algorithm for this option is: Static Round Robin.
#                                                                                         
#  2) exit :     This option is GOOD to bypass GeoIP protections. But reduce the number of EXIT NODES that TOR can use. Repeat the same exit node.
#                      The load balancing algorithm for this option is: Static Round Robin.
#                                                                                         
#  3) speed:  This option is the FASTEST option but reduces the security.
#                      Be carrefull and try to use a HIGH NUMBER OF COUNTRIES if you enable this one.
#                      The load balancing algorithm for this option is: Least Connections Round Robin.
#                      This option is good for downloading or media streaming, but it's not recomended for PENETRATION TESTING.
#                      Also, some contries doesn't have ENTRY GUARDS and EXIT NODES enougth to create valid circuits. Keep your eyes on the
#                      status/helth check URL Monitor to detect and avoid those countries. By default the helth check is: http://127.0.0.1:3129/status
#
# About the load balancing algorithms:
#    Round Robin:                   Each TOR INSTANCE is used in turns. If a TOR INSTANCE have no valid circuits available
#                                   the algorithm will consider this instance down and skip it until have a valid circuit open and ready to be used.
#                                   When the TOR INSTANCE manage to creat a valid circuit, the script will test it and immediately reintroduced into
#                                   the farm, once the full map is recomputed.
#
#    Least Connections Round Robin: The TOR INSTANCE with lowest number of connections receives the next connection.
#                                   Round-robin is performed to ensure that all servers will be used but the fastests TOR INSTANCES could receive
#                                   and process more request then the slow ones. It increase the chances of you use an compromised TOR circuit or in case
#                                   of penetration testing be detected for INTRUSION PREVENT SYSTEMS because you can HIT your target more times with the
#                                   same IP address, allowing the IPS to correlate the behavior and detect your attack.
